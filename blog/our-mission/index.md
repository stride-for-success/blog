The Stride for Success Foundation, established in 2024 by a passionate group of high school runners and a pole vaulter, envisions a more inclusive running community. While running may appear to be a low-cost sport, competing at a high level requires significant financial resources. Unlike many other sports, securing sponsorships in running can be challenging, especially for those who lack the time or resources to build a social media presence or participate in major events.

**Our mission** is to change this narrative. We are committed to ensuring that every runner has the opportunity to achieve their full potential, regardless of their financial circumstances. We believe in the transformative power of running and are dedicated to making the sport accessible to all. Our success is driven by our passionate team and supporters like you, who share our vision of a more equitable running world.
